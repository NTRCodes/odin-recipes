        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sugo all'amatriciana, or alla matriciana, also known as salsa all'amatriciana, is a traditional Italian pasta
            sauce based on guanciale, pecorino romano cheese, tomato, and, in some variations, onion. Originating from the
            town of Amatrice, the Amatriciana is one of the best known pasta sauces in present-day Roman and
            Italian cuisine. The Italian government has named it a traditional agro-alimentary product of Lazio and
            Amatriciana tradizionale is registered as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed in the EU and the UK.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 ounces bucatini pasta</li>
            <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>3 crushed garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1 1/2 ounces guanciale (cured pork cheek), sliced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sliced red onion</li>
            <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1/2 (8 ounces) can crushed San Marzano tomatoes</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 ounce freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1: </strong>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil.
                Stir in bucatini and return to a boil. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until bucatini is tender,
                about 11 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2: </strong>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic cloves; cook until
                golden brown, about 1 minute. Remove with a slotted spoon and discard. Add guanciale; cook and stir until
                crisp and golden, about 4 minutes. Add onion and red pepper flakes; cook and stir until onion is
                translucent, about 3 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, salt, and black pepper. Simmer tomato sauce until flavors
                combine, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3: </strong>Stir bucatini and Pecorino Romano cheese into tomato sauce and toss until evenly
                coated.</li>
        </ol>
