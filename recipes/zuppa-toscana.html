    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Zuppa toscana is a broad based term, literally meaning "Tuscan soup" but in Italy it is called "Minestra di Pane"
        meaning "Bread Soup". Classic zuppa toscana normally is a soup made from kale, zucchini, cannellini beans,
        potatoes, celery, carrots, onion, tomato pulp, extra virgin olive oil, salt, powdered chili,
        toasted Tuscan bread, and rigatino.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound bulk mild Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 1/4 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>5 (13.75 ounce) cans chicken broth</li>
        <li>6 potatoes, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/4 bunch fresh spinach, tough stems removed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Cook the Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in a Dutch oven over medium-high
            heat until crumbly, browned, and no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Cook the bacon in the same Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp,
            about 10 minutes. Drain, leaving a few tablespoons of drippings with the bacon in the bottom of the
            Dutch oven. Stir in the onions and garlic; cook until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pour the chicken broth into the Dutch oven with the bacon and onion mixture;
            bring to a boil over high heat. Add the potatoes, and boil until fork tender, about 20 minutes. Reduce the
            heat to medium and stir in the heavy cream and the cooked sausage; heat through. Mix the spinach into the
            soup just before serving.</li>
    </ol>
